# Randstad Housing Resources
  Housing in the Netherlands can be tough, besides using our Slack channel to network with other home seekers/ potential flatmates, we've curated some resources to aid in the search for a rental home. Things to keep in mind when looking for a rental home:
  - An energy label of C or higher is recommended.
  - If subletting or renting a room/apt from an owner, check whether you can register at the address.
  - Apartments usually come one of three ways: unfinished, unfurnished, or furnished.
  - Unfinished apartments usually require the tenant to install flooring, light fixtures, and potentially appliances / a kitchen. They also tend to be cheaper. It is difficult to find a reliable handyman / contractor in the Netherlands, and this is especially true in Amsterdam.
  - Unfurnished apartments have floors, sometimes ceiling lighting fixtures, and kitchen. It is "finished."
  - Furnished apartments have the above as well as furniture owned by the landlord. They usually require a deposit for the furniture, and often landlords will not change the furniture. For example, if there is a giant dining table in a tiny studio apartment, do not expect that the landlord will change it once you move in.

  ### Housing search resources - Free

Kamernet is mostly rooms, and it is free. Be cautious with the listings on this website, as there is little to no verification process. That being said, many student houses list upcoming vacancies here, and subletting opportunities are also listed here.

### Housing search resources - paid

  -[RentSlam.com](https://rentslam.com/)
This is a **paid** aggregation service, starting at 30Euro / month, with discounts for longer subscriptions. It aggregates listings from all of the big websites, and some of the little ones, and sends those that fit your search criteria to your inbox. You can set up to 3 searches, for example for different cities.

### Check your rent price
Rental prices in the Randstad, and particularly Amsterdam, tend to be egregiously expensive and often illegal. You can use the [Huurcommissie site](https://checkjeprijs.huurcommissie.nl/en/onderwerpen/huurprijs-en-punten/nieuwe-huurprijscheck/rent-check-independent-living-space) to check your rental price against the legal limit.
